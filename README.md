# FarLandsAgain
## About
A plugin to restore the Far Lands on Spigot servers. The starting coordinates can be configured, including making the entire world Far Lands.

## Usage
The compiled plugin, instructions and help can be found here: [FarLandsAgain](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/farlandsagain.8228/).

## Notes
This can only add Far Lands to the vanilla generator and is not intended to support any custom generators. In order to get Far Lands in a custom generator the author of that generator must add the option.

Due to the necessity of modifying the NMS of the vanilla generator directly, any Spigot or Paper branches that alter the generation code may break the plugin. Support is only guaranteed in the base Spigot or Paper.
